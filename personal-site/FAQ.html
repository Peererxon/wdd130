            <summary>How much does a website cost?</summary>
            <p>
              This is the most popular question I'm asked. But there’s a problem
              when it comes to answering. The truth is I don’t know how much
              your website will cost until I know what sort of website you need!
              Each website and client is different, and my costs are based on
              your exact requirements. When I know what you need, I’ll provide a
              transparent, no-obligation quote so you know exactly what you’re
              paying for

          <details>
            <summary>How long will my site take to build?</summary>
            <p>
              Another question I get asked a lot. Again, this varies depending
              on your exact requirements. Some projects can take a few months
              while others a few weeks. Once I’ve discussed your project, I’ll
              give you an idea of just how long the project will take.

            <summary>What is web hosting?</summary>
            <p>
              Web hosting is the service that keeps your website online, and
              it’s an important consideration for any successful online
              business. It can be daunting to choose the right provider as there
              are just so many web hosting companies to pick from. Your website
              needs a reliable, affordable and dependable host – preferably one
              that regularly backs up your website and keeps your files safe and
              secure.

          <details>
            <summary>Are there any other hidden costs for my website?</summary>
            <p>
              No. That’s a promise. I don’t believe in hidden fees or unexpected
              bills.
