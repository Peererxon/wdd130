      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Hello! I am Anderson Gil, and I am a front-end developer and I am going to create a website to let people know how can I help them to move into the digital world. Do you ever hear about how companies that switch to the "digital world" increase their incomes and their capabilities to deliver their services?  I work in a profession that is in the middle to make that happen. I have 3 years of experience and some of the projects that I built are for example digital shops for small and big companies that helped them to increase their product’s sell.  Also, I build applications to help companies to share their models of business. I am willing to expand my horizons to projects looking for build amazing interfaces especially in the mobile world.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        My audience is more than just one kind of person. 
        They are companies that have a desire to move into the digital world or they already are in there but want to build a digital product. 
        They also could be natural persons that want to build a digital product (entrepreneurs for example).

      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <details>
        <summary>
          How much does a website cost?
        </summary>
        <p>
          This is the most popular question I'm asked. But there’s a problem when it comes to answering.

          The truth is I don’t know how much your website will cost until I know what sort of website you need!

          Each website and client is different, and my costs are based on your exact requirements. When I know what you need, I’ll provide a transparent, no-obligation quote so you know exactly what you’re paying for

        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>
          How long will my site take to build?
        </summary>
        <p>
          Another question I get asked a lot. Again, this varies depending on your exact requirements. Some projects can take a few months while others a few weeks.

          Once I’ve discussed your project, I’ll give you an idea of just how long the project will take.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What is web hosting?</summary>
        <p>
          Web hosting is the service that keeps your website online, and it’s an important consideration for any successful online business.

          It can be daunting to choose the right provider as there are just so many web hosting companies to pick from. Your website needs a reliable, affordable and dependable host – preferably one that regularly backs up your website and keeps your files safe and secure.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Are there any other hidden costs for my website?</summary>
        <p>
          No.
          That’s a promise. I don’t believe in hidden fees or unexpected bills.
        </p>

      <details>
        <summary>
          Can I hire you full time?
        </summary>
        <p>
          Yes, you can.
